# NLP

Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information.

But there is a problem:
one person may generate hundreds or thousands of words in a declaration, each sentence with its corresponding complexity. 

If you want to scale and analyze several hundreds, thousands or millions of people or declarations in a given geography, then the situation is unmanageable.
Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.

There are two datasets for our model "Arabic and English DataSets".
The model can classifiy the sentence with accuracy almost 84% and 78% for Arabic and English sentences.
You will find the code for each dataset in different files below.
